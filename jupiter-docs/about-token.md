# Tokens API

> Search, metadata, verification, and organic score for any Solana token

The Tokens API gives you search, metadata, verification status, and trading metrics for any Solana token. Use it to find tokens, display information to users, and filter by trust level.

## History

Token verification on Solana has evolved through several iterations: from the original Solana Token Registry (deprecated 2022), to Jupiter's community-maintained token lists (V1 via GitHub, V2 via Catdet List), to the current system powered by trading metrics, social signals, and Organic Score. Today, [Jupiter VRFD](https://verified.jup.ag) is the latest evolution, expanding beyond verification into token metadata, community content, and insights.

## What You Get

| Field             | Description                                                              |
| ----------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Metadata**      | Name, symbol, icon, decimals, mint address                               |
| **Verification**  | Verification level (verified, unverified, banned)                        |
| **Organic Score** | 0-100 score measuring genuine trading activity                           |
| **Trading Stats** | Volume, price change, buy/sell counts across intervals (5m, 1h, 6h, 24h) |
| **Market Data**   | Holder count, market cap, liquidity                                      |
| **Content**       | Community-submitted text posts, tweets, summaries _(deprecated)_         |

## Verification Levels

Jupiter categorises tokens into trust levels based on trading activity, social presence, and community review:

| Level          | Meaning                                                                       | When to use                      |
| -------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------- |
| **Verified**   | Passed Jupiter's verification process. Legitimate project with real activity. | Safe to display prominently.     |
| **Unverified** | Not yet reviewed or doesn't meet criteria. May still be legitimate.           | Display with caution indicators. |
| **Banned**     | Flagged as malicious, scam, or misleading.                                    | Do not display or warn users.    |

Check the `isVerified` field in the API response. Use `audit.isSus` as an additional signal for suspicious tokens. `audit.isSus` is only present when a token has been flagged, so check for the field's presence rather than its value.

## Organic Score

Organic Score (0-100) measures how genuine a token's trading activity is, filtering out bots, snipers, and copy-trading tools so you can find the signal within the noise. The system identifies non-organic wallets (those trading through known bot and automation channels) and treats the remaining activity as organic.

The score combines four organic signals:

- Organic volume
- Organic holders
- Organic traders
- Organic buyers

A few things to keep in mind when using it:

- **It is relative, not absolute.** Scores are normalised against the rest of the ecosystem. The score says a token is more organic than another, not that it has a specific amount of organic activity. High-volume tokens like SOL and USDC sit near 100 because differences flatten out at that scale.
- **Early growth counts most.** Going from 10 organic buyers to 100 moves the score far more than going from 10,000 to 10,100.
- **Prefer the raw score over the label.** Each token also has an `organicScoreLabel` of `high`, `medium`, or `low`, but these buckets are wide: two tokens can both be `medium` and behave very differently. For filtering, use the raw `organicScore`.

## Token Tags

Token tags are labels applied to tokens for categorisation and discoverability (e.g. `verified`, `lst`, `stocks`, `community`). Tags appear in the Jupiter UI and are available via the [GET /tag](/api-reference/tokens/tag) endpoint.

To get your tokens tagged:

1. Host a public CSV endpoint with mint addresses (one per row)
2. Provide a preferred tag name (short, mobile-friendly)
3. Set a polling interval
4. Reach out via [Discord](https://discord.gg/jup) to begin ingestion
